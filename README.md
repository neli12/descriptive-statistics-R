# Descriptive Statistics in R
(work in progress!!)

Hey there! In this repository you'll find some basic R script for making customized graphs and figure to represent in the best possible way the distribution of your dataset. In these examples, I am using a small dataset that contain the values of two variables: `Clay content` and `OM` (organic matter).

- `1.script_density`: density plots of training and validation sets.
- `2.script_boxplots`: boxplots of training and validation sets in a facet configuration.
- `3.script_histograms_and_dist`: histograms and distribution of two datasets (clay content and OM) in the same graph.
- `4.script_boxplots_LAI`: Time series boxplot of the Leaf Area Index (LAI). This script can be used to see the distributions of a dataset obtained in different period. You can find this boxplot in the following [article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11119-022-09896-1){target="_blank"}
