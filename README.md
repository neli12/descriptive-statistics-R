# Descriptive Statistics Figures in R
(work in progress!!)

Hey there! In this repository you'll find some basic R script for making customized graphs and figure to represent in the best possible way the distribution of your dataset. In these examples, I am using a small dataset that contain the values of two variables: `Clay content` and `OM` (organic matter). The figures can be found in the folder `figures`.  

For some scripts (e.g. `script_boxplots_LAI`), I am not providing the dataset because they are not of free access. Instead, I am providing the reference to the article where the figure was published or the contact of the author of the dataset.

- `1.script_density`: density plots of training and validation sets.
- `2.script_boxplots`: boxplots of training and validation sets in a facet configuration.
- `3.script_histograms_and_dist`: histograms and distribution of two datasets (clay content and OM) in the same graph.
- `4.script_boxplots_LAI`: This script presents time series boxplot of the Leaf Area Index (LAI). This script can be used to see the distributions of a dataset obtained in different period. You can find this boxplot in Fig. 8 of the following <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11119-022-09896-1" target="_blank">article</a>.
- `5.script_barplot_circ`: This script is used to present a circular barplot to differentiate groups.
- `6.script_corrplot`: Making different types of correlation plots.
- `script_descriptive_statistics`: to perform descriptive graphs (boxplots, histograms, ggridges, etc.). For this, use the dataset `dados`.
